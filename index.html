        <h2>
          Come join us at the Trondheim Community Science Museum where we’re
          committed to making science accessible to all.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.The
          aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
          the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
          passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.We believe
          science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live
          through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on
          the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits
          are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science
          come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to
          life at night when everyone’s gone home)
        </p>

              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.<br /><br />
              You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or
              why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?
              Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds,
              so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.<br /><br />
              We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
              Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
              experiment with our team of experts.

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them.<br /><br />
              Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
              facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
              for a visit.
